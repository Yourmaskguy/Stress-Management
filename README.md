# Stress-Management

### Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of a Stress Management Dashboard for Wellbeing Corp, a health and wellness company dedicated to helping organizations manage employee stress levels. The primary goal of this dashboard is to provide actionable insights into the stress factors affecting employees, enabling HR and management teams to make informed decisions for improving workplace well-being.

### Problem Statement

Stress is a significant issue impacting employee well-being and productivity. This analysis aims to identify the key factors contributing to stress, including prevalent stressors and their associated physical and emotional symptoms. By understanding these elements, Wellbeing Corp can develop targeted strategies to effectively manage and reduce stress, ultimately promoting a healthier work environment.

### Project Objectives:

1. Analyze the Relationship Between Emotional Symptoms and Average Heart Rate
- Investigate how various emotional symptoms correlate with fluctuations in average heart rate to understand their impact on physiological stress responses.

2. Identify Key Stress Triggers by Gender
- Explore and compare the primary sources of stress among different gender groups to uncover potential patterns and tailor stress management solutions accordingly.

3. Calculate and Analyze Average Cortisol Levels by Hour
- Examine hourly fluctuations in cortisol levels to identify peak stress periods and provide insights for stress-reducing interventions at critical times.

4. Evaluate the Impact of Stress Duration on Sleep Quality
- Assess how prolonged periods of stress affect sleep quality, focusing on identifying trends that can inform wellness and recovery programs.

5. Examine the Influence of Stress Levels on Mood
- Analyze how varying stress levels impact mood changes, offering insights into emotional well-being and potential areas for intervention.

## Data Description

### Data Sources

The dataset for this project is sourced from Wellbeing Corp, a health and wellness company that collects employee stress-related data through comprehensive surveys and monitoring systems. The data includes various dimensions of employee well-being, including emotional symptoms, physiological measures (such as heart rate and cortisol levels), and demographic information.

### Data Collection

Data was collected using a multi-faceted approach, which included:

- Surveys: Employees completed standardized questionnaires that assessed their emotional symptoms, stress triggers, and overall mental well-being. These surveys included quantitative ratings on various stress-related factors.

- Monitoring Systems: Wearable devices were used to capture real-time physiological data, including heart rate and cortisol levels. This data was logged continuously to provide accurate insights into employees’ stress responses throughout their daily activities.

- Health Records: Historical health records, which included information on physical symptoms related to stress (such as insomnia, fatigue, and high blood pressure), were incorporated to analyze trends over time.


### Data Characteristics

The dataset includes the following variables:

- ID: Unique identifier for each employee
  
- Full Name: Employee's full name

- Severity: Severity of stress (e.g., mild, moderate, severe)
- Sleep Quality: Quality of sleep reported (e.g., poor, fair, good)
- Mood: Mood reported by the employee
- Heart Rate: Heart rate measurement (bpm)
- Cortisol Level: Cortisol level measurement (µg/dL)
- Stress Level Score: Calculated score representing the level of stress

#### Data Types:
The dataset includes both categorical (e.g., gender, stress sources) and numerical data (e.g., heart rate, cortisol levels).

## Methodology

The methodology for this project encompasses several key stages: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical analysis. The tools utilized throughout the project include SQL Server for data manipulation and analysis, Excel for data visualization and dashboard creation, and Microsoft Word for documentation.


### Tools Used
This project utilized several tools to facilitate data analysis, visualization, and documentation:

- SQL Server(SMSS) : Used for data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. SQL queries were employed to clean the data, perform analyses, and create views.
   - [Download SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) and [Download SMSS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15)

- Microsoft Excel: Utilized for exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and dashboard creation. Excel’s pivot tables, charts, and slicers provided a dynamic way to present findings and enable user interaction.
